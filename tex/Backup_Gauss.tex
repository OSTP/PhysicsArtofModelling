\question A cube of side $L$ is placed in a uniform field (magnitude $E$) with edges parallel to the field lines.
\begin{parts}
\part What is the net flux through the cube?
\part What is the flux through each of its six faces?
\part Now, imagine that we shut off the uniform field, and instead place a charge $Q$ at the center of the cube. What is the flux through one face of the cube?
\end{parts}
\begin{finalanswer}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Zero.
\item The two faces that are perpendicular to the field will have a non-zero flux of $\Phi = EL^2$ and $\Phi = -EL^2$. The other faces will have a flux of zero. 
\item \begin{align*}
\Phi=\frac{1}{6}\frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{finalanswer}
\begin{solution}
\begin{parts}
\part Since there is no enclosed charge, the net flux out of the cube is zero.
\part The two faces that are perpendicular to the field will have a non-zero flux of $\Phi = EL^2$ and $\Phi = -EL^2$. The other faces will have a flux of zero. 
\part By symmetry each face will have the same flux going through it, corresponding to one sixth of the total flux:
\begin{align*}
\Phi=\frac{1}{6}\frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}
\end{align*}
\end{parts}
\end{solution}


\question A long cylindrical rod of radius $a$ is made from an insulating material with a uniform charge density $\rho$. Find the electric field a distance $r$ from the centre of the rod for
\begin{parts}
\part $0<r<a$
\part $r>a$
\end{parts} 
\begin{finalanswer}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \begin{align*}
E=\frac{\rho r}{2\epsilon_0}
\end{align*}
\item \begin{align*}
E=\frac{\rho a^2}{2\epsilon_0r}
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{finalanswer}
\begin{solution}
\begin{parts}
\part We consider a gaussian surface or radius $r$ and length $L$. The amount of charge enclosed is:
\begin{align*}
Q^{enc}=\rho \pi r^2 L
\end{align*}
The electric field is always perpendicular to the curved surface and parallel to the ends of the cylinder. The flux is thus given by:
\begin{align*}
\Phi=E2\pi r L
\end{align*}
Applying Gauss' Law:
\begin{align*}
\Phi&=\frac{Q^{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\\
E2\pi r L &= \frac{\rho \pi r^2 L}{\epsilon_0}\\
\therefore E &= \frac{\rho r}{2\epsilon_0}
\end{align*}
\part We repeat the same procedure, but note that the charge enclosed is different for a gaussian surface of radius $r>a$:
\begin{align*}
Q^{enc}=\rho \pi a^2 L
\end{align*}
The electric field is always perpendicular to the curved surface and parallel to the ends of the cylinder. The flux is thus given by:
\begin{align*}
\Phi=E2\pi r L
\end{align*}
Applying Gauss' Law:
\begin{align*}
\Phi&=\frac{Q^{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\\
E2\pi r L &= \frac{\rho \pi a^2 L}{\epsilon_0}\\
\therefore E &= \frac{\rho a^2}{2\epsilon_0 r}
\end{align*}
\end{parts}
\end{solution}

\question Consider a sphere of radius $r_0$ which has a sphere of radius $\frac{r_0}{2}$ hollowed out as shown in Figure \ref{fig:gauss:HollowSphere}. Suppose the sphere of radius $r$ has a volume charge density of $\rho$, while the hollowed out section of the sphere carries no charge density. Points A and C are located in the centres of their respective spheres.
\begin{parts}
	\part What is the magnitude and direction of the electric field at point A?
	\part What is the magnitude and direction of the electric field at point B?
\end{parts}
\capfig{0.3\textwidth}{figures/Gauss/HollowSphere.png}{\label{fig:gauss:HollowSphere}A uniformly charged sphere with a hollowed out cavity.}
\begin{finalanswer}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item \begin{align*}
		E=\frac{\rho r_0}{6\epsilon_0}
		\end{align*} which points to the right.
		\item \begin{align*}
		E=\frac{17\rho r_0}{54\epsilon_0}
		\end{align*} 
		which points to the left.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{finalanswer}
\begin{solution}
	Instead of a hollowed sphere, we consider this is the superposition of a sphere of radius $r_0$ centred at A with charge density $\rho$ and a sphere of radius $\frac{r_0}{2}$ centred at C with charge density $-\rho$.
	\begin{parts}
		\part At point A, by symmetry, the bigger sphere will contribute no electric field, whereas for the smaller sphere with the negative charge density, we use a gaussian surface centred at C with radius $\\frac{r_0}{2}$. The charge enclosed is:
		\begin{align*}
		Q^{enc}=\rho\frac{4}{3}\pi \frac{r_0^3}{8}
		\end{align*}
		The flux (which is inwards, as the field points to the right):
		\begin{align*}
		\Phi = E4\pi \frac{r_0^2}{4}
		\end{align*}
		Applying Gauss' Law:
		\begin{align*}
		\Phi&=\frac{Q^{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\\
		E4\pi \frac{r_0^2}{4} &= \frac{\rho\frac{4}{3}\pi \frac{r_0^3}{8}}{\epsilon_0}\\
		E &= \frac{\rho r_0}{6\epsilon_0}\\
		\end{align*}
		which points to the right.
		\part We use the same principle, but this time both spheres will contribute to the electric field. First, for the bigger positive sphere, we choose a gaussian surface centred at A with radius $r_0$:
		\begin{align*}
		\Phi&=\frac{Q^{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\\
		E^+4\pi r_0^2 &=\frac{\rho\frac{4}{3}\pi r_0^3}{\epsilon_0}\\
		\therefore  E^+ &=\frac{\rho r_0}{3\epsilon_0}\\
		\end{align*}
		which will point to the left (outwards). For the negative smaller sphere, we choose a gaussian surface centred at C with radius $\frac{3}{2}r_0$:
		\begin{align*}
		\Phi&=\frac{Q^{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\\
		E^-4\pi \frac{9r_0^2}{4} &= \frac{\rho\frac{4}{3}\pi \frac{r_0^3}{8}}{\epsilon_0}\\
		\therefore E^- &= \frac{\rho r_0}{54\epsilon_0}\\
		\end{align*}
		which points to the right. The net field will point to the left and have magnitude:
		\begin{align*}
		E=E^+-E^-=\frac{\rho r_0}{\epsilon_0}\left( \frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{54} \right)=\frac{17\rho r_0}{54\epsilon_0}
		\end{align*}
	\end{parts}
\end{solution}

%was this question done incorrectly? 

%I am going to change this such that you need to integrate, but I will run it through Ryan Martin or someone else to make sure that the logic is sound. I'll keep a version of this that is unchanged just to make sure I'm not wrong in my assumptions.
\question A cube of side $l$ has one corner at the origin of a coordinate system and extends along the positive $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes. If the electric field in this region is given by $\vec E(x,y,z)=(ay+b)\hat y$ ($a$ and $b$ are positive constants), what is the charge enclosed by the cube?
\begin{finalanswer}
$Q=\epsilon_0al^3$
\end{finalanswer}
\begin{solution}
Since the flux is in the $y$ direction, only the two faces that are in the $xz$ plane will have net flux through them. For the face that is at $y=0$, the electric field is constant $E=b$, and the flux will be:
\begin{align*}
\Phi_1=\int \vec E\cdot d\vec A=-\int EdA=-b\int dA=-bl^2
\end{align*}
where the minus sign indicates that this is flux into to the cube. For the face that is at $y=l$, the electric field is again constant ($E=al+b$), and the flux is given by:
\begin{align*}
\Phi_2=\int \vec E\cdot d\vec A=\int EdA=al+b\int dA=al^3+bl^2
\end{align*}
The net flux is then:
\begin{align*}
\Phi=\Phi_1+\Phi_2=al^3.
\end{align*}
By Gauss' law, the charge enclosed is:
\begin{align*}
Q=\epsilon_0\Phi=\epsilon_0al^3
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
