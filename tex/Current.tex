In this chapter, we introduce tools to model electric current, namely, the motion of charges inside a conductor. We will also introduce the notion of resistance, as well as the resistor, a common component in electric circuits. This chapter will show how to relate charges moving at the microscopic level to macroscopic quantities such as current and voltage.

\section{Current}
In the preceding chapters, we examined ``electrostatic'' systems; those for which charges are not in motion. In electrostatic systems, the electric field inside of a conductor is zero (by definition, or charges would be moving, since they are free to move in a conductor). We argued that if charges are deposited onto a conductor, they would quickly arrange themselves into a static configuration (on the surface of the conductor). 

Instead, we can build systems were charge move in a conductor. If we apply a fixed potential difference across a conductor, this will result in an electric field inside the conductor and the charges within will move (``conduct''). In general, this requires that there be some sort of circuit formed, whereby charges enter one end of the conductor and exit the other. The most simple circuit that one can construct is to simply connect the two terminals of a battery to the ends of the conductor, as illustrated in Figure TODO. 

A battery (as we will see in more detail in Section TODO-REF-NEXT-CHAPTER) is a device that provides a source of charges, and a fixed potential difference. For example, a $\SI{9}{V}$ battery has two terminals with fixed, constant, voltage of $\SI{9}{V}$ between them.
%TODO A figure showing a simple battey, potential difference, charges going out of battery, into conductor, back out into battery.
``Electric current'' is defined to be the rate at which charges cross a given plane in a given direction (usually a plane perpendicular to some conductor through which we want to define the current). For a wire or a conductor, we define current, $I$, as the total amount of charge, $\Delta Q$, that flows through any cross-section of the conductor during an amount of time, $\Delta t$:
\begin{align*}
\Aboxed{I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=\frac{dQ}{dt}}
\end{align*}
where we take a derivative if the rate at which charges flow is not constant in time. The S.I. unit of current is the Amp√®re (\si{A}), which is a base unit. The Coulomb (charge), is a derived unit ($\SI{1}{C}=\SI{1}{A\cdot s}$). Current is defined to be positive in the direction in which positive charges flow. In almost all cases, it is negative electrons that flow through a material; the current is defined to be in the opposite direction from which the actual electrons are flowing.

Note that the definition of electric current is very similar to the ``flow rate'', $Q$, that we defined as the volume flow of a liquid across a given cross-section (Section REF-TODO). As we continue to develop our description of current, you will notice that there are many similarities between describing the flow of an incompressible fluid and describing the flow of charges in a conductor.

We think of current as a macroscopic quantity, something that we can easily measure in the lab. Current is a measure of the average rate at which charges are moving through the conductor, and not a measure of what is going on at a microscopic level. In order to model the motion of electrons through a conductor, we introduce the ``current density'', $\vec j$:
\begin{align*}
\Aboxed{\vec j = \frac{I}{A}\hat n}
\end{align*}
where, $I$, is the current through the conductor of cross-sectional area, $A$, and $\hat n$ is a vector perpendicular to the cross-section.  The current density allows us to develop a microscopic description of the current, since it is the electric current per unit area. Given the current density, $\vec j$, one can always determine the current through a surface with area, $A$, and normal vector, $\hat n$:
\begin{align*}
I = A(\vec j\cdot \hat n)
\end{align*}

\section{Microscopic model of current}
\label{sec:current:micromodel}
Consider a cylindrical conductor of cross-sectional area, $A$, and length, $L$, as shown in Figure TODO. A potential difference, $\Delta V$, is applied across the length of the conductor, so that there is an electric field everywhere within the conductor. If the conductor were made of empty space, electron would leave the negative terminal of the battery, convert the potential energy from the battery into kinetic energy, $e\Delta V$, as they accelerate through the potential difference, and arrive at the positive terminal with a high speed. In reality, the conductor is made of matter, and electrons do not accelerate through the conductor. Instead, electrons accelerate over only a short distance before colliding with an atom in the material (rather, a tightly bound electron in the material), losing its kinetic energy to the material, and accelerating again, as illustrated in Figure TODO.

Thus, when the electrons arrive at the positive side of the conductor, they have not gained any kinetic energy. Instead, they lost that kinetic energy to atoms of the conducting material through collisions; those atoms then vibrate which we can measure as an increase in temperature of the material. When current flows through a conductor, that conductor will heat up; this is how the heating elements in your toaster work!
%TODO Illustration of electron moving through conductor, colliding with atoms, atoms vibrating, drift velocity
We model the motion of electrons as charges ``drifting'' through the conductor with a velocity, $\vec v_d$, the ``drift velocity''. In reality, of course, the electrons are only moving on average with the drift velocity, and their instantaneous speed is generally much larger than the drift velocity and can be in any direction, as illustrated above. 

Suppose that, inside the conductor, there are a certain number of electrons per unit volume, $n$, that are available for conduction (the other electrons are too tightly bound to their atoms to conduct). Different materials will have different values of $n$. Consider the motion of the conduction electrons present in a section of length, $l$, of the conductor, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:current:microcurrent}.
\capfig{0.4\textwidth}{figures/Current/microcurrent.png}{\label{fig:current:microcurrent} A section of electrons of length $l$ drifting through a conductor of cross-sectional area, $A$.}
The amount of charge, $\Delta Q$, contained in a section of the conductor with length, $l$, is given by:
\begin{align*}
\Delta Q= -e n Al
\end{align*}
where $Al$ is the volume of that section of the conductor, and, $e$, is the magnitude of the charge of the electron. The negative sign is to indicate that the charges are negative (they are electrons). That charge will take an amount of time, $\Delta t$, to flow through a given plane of the conductor, so that we can relate the length of the section, $l$, to the drift speed and $\Delta t$:
\begin{align*}
v_d &= \frac{l}{\Delta t}\\
l&=v_d\Delta t
\end{align*}
Thus, the current that flows through a cross-section of the conductor is given by:
\begin{align*}
I&=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=\frac{-e n Al}{\Delta t}=-enAv_d\\
\therefore\Aboxed{I&=-enAv_d}
\end{align*}
which allows us to connect a macroscopic quantity, current, to the microscopic description of charges moving. Note that the negative sign reflects the fact that the current (of positive charges) is in the opposite direction from the drift velocity of the (negative) electrons. The current density is directly related to the microscopic quantities, since it does not depend on the (macroscopic) cross-sectional area, $A$, of the conductor:
\begin{align*}
\vec j&=\frac{I}{A}\hat n = -en\vec v_d\\
\therefore \Aboxed{\vec j &= -en\vec v_d}
\end{align*}
where, again, the negative sign indicates that the current density is in the opposite direction from the actual drift velocity of the electrons.

%TODO Example where they calculate drift velocity with realistic numbers. Perhaps compare with actual speed of electrons?

\section{Ohm's Law}
In the previous section, we developed a microscopic model of charges moving in a conductor, but did not describe how this motion is affected by the electric field in the conductor (or equivalently, the potential difference across the conductor). ``Ohm's Law'' states that the current density, $\vec j$, in the conductor is proportional to the electric field, $\vec E$, in the conductor:
\begin{align*}
\vec j &\propto \vec E\\
\Aboxed{\vec j &= \sigma \vec E}
\end{align*}
where we have introduced the ``conductivity'', $\sigma$, which is a property of the material from which the conductor is made. The conductivity is a measure of how large a current density (and by extension, current) there will be in material given a certain electric field. Materials with a high conductivity are said to be good conductors, as a large current will result from a small electric field. Gold and copper are example of materials with a high conductivity. 
 %TODO Checkpoint question: What is the conductivity of an insulator? 0 (correct), around 1, infinite
\subsection{Resistivity}
For convenience, one often describes how well a material conducts charges using the ``resistivity'', $\rho$, which is simply defined as the inverse of conductivity:
\begin{align*}
\rho = \frac{1}{\sigma}
\end{align*}
Materials with a high resistivity are poor conductors; they tend to ``resist'' the formation of a current when an electric field is applied. Insulators have high resistivity. The resistivity of most (but not all) materials has been observe to depend linearly on the temperature of the material. One can imagine that, as atoms in the material vibrate more, it is more difficult for electrons to conduct through the material as they will interact with more atoms. The resistivity, $\rho$, at a certain temperature, $T$, is usually modelled as follows:
\begin{align*}
\rho(T)=\rho_0\left[ 1 + \alpha (T-T_0)\right]
\end{align*}
where, $\rho_0$, is a reference resistivity, measured at the reference temperature, $T_0$ (usually $\SI{20}{\degree C}$, and $\alpha$ is the ``temperature'' coefficient of the material. The temperature dependence of the resistivity is illustrated in Figure TODO.
%TODO Labelled figure showing rho(T), rho_0, T_0

%TODO Checkpoint question: what is the slope of the resistivity vs temperature shown in Figure TODO? - it's not alpha, but give that as an option!

Table TODO shows a list of common materials and their conductivity, resistivity, and temperature coefficients (defined at a reference temperature $T_0=\SI{20}{\degree C}$.

%TODO Table showing properties for common materials

\section{Resistors}
A conductor with current going through it (or current that could go through it) is generally called a ``resistor'', to emphasize that charges will experience resistance as they travel through the conductor (as they collide with atoms in the conductor). In this section, we describe resistors, how to combine them, and how to model the heat that is generated when charges collide with the atoms in the resistor.
\subsection{Resistance}
Consider a macroscopic conductor, with length, $L$, and cross-sectional area, $A$. A potential difference, $\Delta V$, is applied across the length of the conductor, resulting in an electric field, $\vec E$, along its length. To good approximation, one can model the two ends of the conductor as parallel plates, so that the magnitude of the electric field throughout the conductor is constant in magnitude and direction and has strength given by:
\begin{align*}
E=\frac{\Delta V}{L}
\end{align*}
Combining this with Ohm's Law, we have:
\begin{align*}
j&=\sigma E\\
\therefore j&=\sigma\frac{\Delta V}{L}\\
\end{align*}
Since the current density is a microscopic quantity, we can replace it with the current, $I$, a macroscopic quantity, for the conductor of cross-sectional area, $A$, to find:
\begin{align*}
j&=\frac{I}{A}\\
\therefore I&=jA=\sigma\frac{\Delta V}{L}A
\end{align*}
This last equation is often written by isolating the potential difference:
\begin{align*}
\Aboxed{\Delta V = \rho \frac{L}{A} I}
\end{align*}
where we replaced the inverse of the conductivity with the resistivity. This last equation is the equivalent of Ohm's Law, but written for a macroscopic conductor of length, $L$, cross-sectional area, $A$, and made of a material with resistivity, $rho$. Written in this way, Ohm's Law is a statement that the current through a conductor is proportional to the voltage applied across that conductor. The constant of proportionality, $R$, is called the ``resistance'':
\begin{align*}
\Aboxed{\Delta V = RI}
\end{align*}
This last equation is often called ``Ohm's Law'', even if, technically, Ohm's Law is the relation between current density and electric field. Rather than refer to the object as a conductor, one refers to the object as a ``resistor''. A resistor is a macroscopic object whose ``resistance'' can be characterized by a single value, $R$.. its resistance. The resistance of a resistor can be determined from its macroscopic properties (length and cross-sectional area) and from the material from which it is made (with a given resistivity):
\begin{align*}
\Aboxed{R = \rho \frac{L}{A} }
\end{align*}
The (derived) S.I. unit of resistance is the ``Ohm'', (\si{\Omega}).
%TODO Checkpoint question, what is the SI unit of resistivity (give options in terms of Ohms and base units)

The model for resistance of a resistor to electric current under a fixed potential difference, $\Delta V$, is identical to the model that we derived in Section \ref{sec:fluidmechanics:poiseuille} to describe the Poiseuille flow, $Q$, in a pipe with resistance, $R$, under a pressure difference, $\Delta P$:
\begin{align*}
\Delta P = RQ
\end{align*} 
Thus, one can think of electric current by analogy to the incompressible flow of a viscous fluid through a pipe. If the pipe is longer, it opposes more resistance to the flow of liquid, just as a longer resistor has a larger resistance to current. A pipe with a wider cross-section has less resistance to the flow of liquid, just as a resistor with a larger cross sectional area, $A$, has a lower resistance.
\subsection{Combining resistors}
Resistors are the most common component in circuits, and we show below how to model the equivalent resistance of two resistor that are combined in ``parallel'' or in ``series''.

Figure TODO shows two resistors, $R_1$ and $R_2$, connected in ``series''. A potential difference, $\Delta V$, is applied across the combination of resistors.

%TODO Figure showing two resistors in series, the potential difference, the same current.
By analogy with fluid mechanics, the charges that enter resistor, $R_1$, must exit the resistor at the same rate, and then cross the second resistor, $R_2$. In other words, what comes into $R_1$ must come back out of $R_2$, since there is no place for the charges to go. This is the electrical equivalent of ``continuity'' in fluid mechanics. \textbf{When resistors are combined in series, both resistors will have the same current, $I$}.

Ohm's Law (the macroscopic version), must also be true for each resistor:
\begin{align*}
\Delta V_1 &= R_1I\\
\Delta V_1 &= R_2I
\end{align*}
where, $\Delta V_1$ and $\Delta V_2$, are the potential differences across each resistor. $\Delta V_1$ and $\Delta V_2$ must sum to $\Delta V$:
\begin{align*}
\Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2=\Delta V
\end{align*}
since the potential energy (per unit charge) that is lost in each resistor must equal to the total potential energy (per unit charge) that was lost in going through the combination of resistors. Combining this last equation with Ohm's Law for each resistor, we can model the series combination of resistor as having an ``effective resistance'', $R_{eff}$, given by:
\begin{align*}
\Delta V &= \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2=R_1I+R_2I=(R_1+R_2)I=R_{eff}I\\
 \Aboxed{R_{eff}&=R_1+R_2}\quad \text{(Series resistors)}
\end{align*}
It makes sense that the equivalent resistance if found by summing the two resistors, when these are in series. If the two resistors are made of the same material and have the same cross-sectional area, combining them in series is equivalent to fabricating a longer resistor with the two lengths added together.

Figure TODO shows two resistors, with resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$, in a parallel combination. A potential difference, $\Delta V$, is applied across the combination of resistors. \textbf{When resistors are combined in parallel, both resistors have the same potential difference across them}.
%TODO  Figure showing two resistors in parallel, the potential difference, the currents.

Applying Ohm's Law to each resistor, we find that they each have difference currents going through them:
\begin{align*}
I_1&=\frac{\Delta V}{R_1}\\
I_2&=\frac{\Delta V}{R_2}
\end{align*}
%TODO Checkpoint question: in a parallel configuration, which resistor will have the larger current? (same, bigger R, smaller R (correct), same)

The total current, $I$, that enters the combination of resistors, must also exit the combination of resistor (continuity), so the total current, $I$, is the sum of the current through each resistor:
\begin{align*}
I=I_1+I_2
\end{align*}
Combining this with Ohm's Law, we find:
\begin{align*}
I&=I_1+I_2=\frac{\Delta V}{R_1}+\frac{\Delta V}{R_2}=\left( \frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2} \right)\Delta V\\
\therefore \Delta V &= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}}I
\end{align*}
Thus, the effective resistance, $R_{eff}$, of two resistors connected in parallel is given by:
\begin{align*}
\Aboxed{R_{eff}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}}=\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}}\quad \text{(Parallel resistors)}
\end{align*}
where the two forms that are given are equivalent. The effective resistance of two resistors in parallel is smaller than the resistance of either resistor. This makes sense, because combining resistors in parallel is analogous to fabricating a single resistance with a larger cross-sectional area, with ``more room'' for charges to flow.

\subsection{Electrical power dissipated in resistors}
As we discussed in Section \ref{sec:current:micromodel}, charges that move through a resistor do not gain kinetic energy. Instead, the electric potential energy available from the voltage applied across the resistor is converted into heat, as a result of charges colliding with atoms in the material. The net potential energy, $\Delta U$, available to a single charge, $q$, is given by:
\begin{align*}
\Delta U=q\Delta V
\end{align*}
If there are many charges going through the resistor, the rate at which they will dissipate energy in the resistor, $P$, is given by:
\begin{align*}
P&=\frac{d}{dt}\Delta U=\frac{d}{dt}q\Delta V=I\Delta V\\
\therefore P&=I\Delta V
\end{align*}
$P$ corresponds to the rate at which energy is dissipated in the resistor, and has dimensions of power. Combining this with Ohm's Law, the power that is dissipated in a resistor can be written in different ways:
\begin{align*}
\Aboxed{P=\Delta V I=\frac{(\Delta V)^2}{R}=I^2R}
\end{align*}

One can rate a power supply, such as a battery, by the amount of power that it can deliver. Power supplies are usually designed to supply a fixed potential difference; for example, a $\SI{9}{V}$ battery supplies a constant voltage of $\SI{9}{V}$. If a small resistor is connected across the terminals of the battery, a large current, $I$, will flow through the resistor. In principle, the current through the resistor will be given by Ohm's Law, $I=\Delta V/R$. However, by making the resistance increasingly smaller, the current will increase, and the power dissipated by the resistor, $\Delta V I$, would increase indefinitely. Obviously, this is not possible, as it requires the battery to supply energy at the same ever increasing rate. In practice, as the resistance across a batter is decreased, the current through the resistor will only increase until $\Delta V I$ is equal to the maximal power dissipated by the battery. As the resistance across the battery is further decreased, the voltage across the battery must start to decrease as well, so that the power dissipated in the resistor, $\Delta V I$, does not exceed the power that the battery can supply.

\subsection{Superconductors}
Superconductors are materials that, under certain conditions, have zero resistivity. A resistor made from a superconducting material will thus have zero resistance. It is beyond the scope of this textbook to describe how superconductivity arises in materials, however, it is worth know that these exist. Typically, superconductivity arises in materials when they are cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero, although some materials exihibit superconductivity at much higher temperatures ($\sim\SI{100}{\degree K}$ (TODO Check this!!!). Superconducting materials are often used when one needs a large electric current, such as in a powerful electro-magnet.

                                                         
\section{Alternating voltages and currents}
%Description of voltage, current, power through a resistor
So far, we have modelled how current propagates through  resistor under a constant potential difference, $\Delta V$. This is called ``direct current'' (DC) as the charges move in a constant direction through the resistor. Batteries supply fixed voltages, and circuits with batteries will almost always have DC current. The voltage that is supplied between two of the sockets in a household electrical outlet is ``alternating'', and leads to ``alternating current'' (AC), where charges move back and forth, with no net displacement. 

The potential difference across a household outlet varies sinusoidally:
\begin{align*}
\Delta V (t) = \Delta V_0 \sin(\omega t)
\end{align*}
where $\Delta V_0$ is the maximal amplitude of the voltage ($\SI{110}{V}$ in North America, $\SI{220}{V}$ in Europe), and $\omega = 2\pi f$, is the angular frequency of the voltage ($f=\SI{60}{Hz}$ in North America, $f=\SI{50}{Hz}$ in Europe). When a resistor with resistance, $R$, is connected to an AC voltage, the resulting current, given by Ohm's Law, is also alternating:
\begin{align*}
I(t)=\frac{\Delta V(t)}{R}=\frac{\Delta V_0}{R}\sin(\omega t)=I_0\sin(\omega t)
\end{align*}
On average, the alternating current through a resistor is zero. However, this does not mean that zero potential energy is dissipated, since the charges in the resistor will still collide with atoms as this oscillate back and forth within the conductor. We can define the average power, $\bar P$, that is dissipated in the resistor as the  power that is dissipated over one oscillation cycle (with period, $T$). To obtain the latter, we calculate the total energy, $E$, dissipated in the resistor over one cycle so that the power is simply given by $E/T$. We divide the interval of time, $T$, into infinitesimally small intervals, $dt$, so that the infinitesimal energy, $dE$, dissipated in an infinitesimal time, $dt$, is given by:
\begin{align*}
dE=P(t) dt
\end{align*}
The total energy dissipated in one period is then given by:
\begin{align*}
E=\int dE = \int_0^T P(t)dt
\end{align*}
so that the power dissipated in one cycle is given by:
\begin{align*}
\bar P=\frac{E}{T}=\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T P(t)dt
\end{align*}
The instantaneous power, $P(t)=I^2(t)R$, can be substituted for $P(t)$:
\begin{align*}
\bar P = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^TP(t)dt=\frac{1}{T}\int_0^TI(t)^2Rdt=RI_0^2\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T\sin^2(\omega t)dt=\frac{1}{2}RI_0^2
\end{align*}
where we used the fact that $T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$ to evaluate the integral. In order to make the formula similar to the DC equivalent (without the additional factor of $1/2$), we can define the ``root mean square'' current, $I_{rms}$, as an average current, from which we can calculate the average power that is dissipated in a resistor:
\begin{align*}
I_{rms}&=\frac{I_0}{\sqrt 2}\\
\therefore\bar P&=I_{rms}^2R
\end{align*}
Similarly, one can define the ``root mean square'' voltage, $\Delta V_{rms}$, so that the average power dissipated with alternating current can be written in the same form as for the DC case:
\begin{align*}
V_{rms}&=\frac{I_0}{\sqrt 2}\\
\therefore\bar P&=I_{rms}^2R =\frac{\Delta V_{rms}^2}{R}=I_{rms}\Delta V_{rms}
\end{align*}

\section{Electrical safety}
The models that we have developed to describe current can inform us on ways to avoid being injured by electricity in our common lives. The two main hazards associated with electricity are fire and electrocution. Typically, an electrical fire is the result of a large current going through a resistor, as the power dissipated in a resistor is proportional the square of the current through that resistor. If you connect an appliance that draws a large current to your outlets, the wires in your house could heat up enough to cause a fire. This danger is primarily mitigated by using ``fuses'' or ``circuit breakers'' that will interrupt the circuit if the current is too large. A fuse is a simple device with a thin wire (high resistance) that will melt and break if too much current goes through it (which is designed to happen long before the wires in your house start to overheat). A circuit breaker is a resettable switch that opens under a large current. Modern houses do not use fuses any more, since they have to be replaced every time they are ``blown''.

Electrocution is a form of injury that is the result of a current crossing the body. The amount of damage that is caused by the current crossing through the body depends on a variety of factors, including the resistance of the person's skin, whether the current goes their heart, and whether it is AC or DC current. In order to cause injury, the power supply must also be able to supply enough power to provide a large enough current. For example, although a car battery can only supply a $\SI{12}{V}$ potential difference, it is designed to provide enough mechanical power to ``crank'' a car engine, which takes a fair amount of power. Thus, car batteries can provide a large current and can pose a serious electrocution hazard.
