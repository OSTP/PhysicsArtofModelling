\begin{problem}{The unobservant police officer}
Brent is driving his son Ty to his baseball game. On the highway, Ty points out that the cars driving in the opposite direction seem to be going very fast, about $\SI{140}{km/h}$, but the police officer at the side of the road isn't pulling anyone over for speeding. How slow would Brent have to be driving for the other car to be exceeding the $\SI{80}{km/h}$ speed limit?
