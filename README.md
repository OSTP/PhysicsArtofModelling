This is an open-access textbook for calculus-based introductory physics courses. Anyone that complies with the license is welcome to modify and use this work for their own use, as well as contribute. The textbook is specifically intended for a flipped-classroom approach, wherein students complete readings at home and the material is then discussed in class. The textbook thus contains questions and activities to engage readers. This text also includes a curriculum in experimental physics, detailing the scientific method and process, including chapters that cover writing and reviewing proposals, writing and reviewing reports, analyzing data, and an introduction to python. Finally, this textbook was written with many contributions from students! We hope that you may find it useful, and we are interested to know if you are using it!

In addition to the numerous examples throughout the narrative and two sample problems at the end of each chapter, the textbook comes with an extensive "question library", which is provided with just questions, or with answers (but not solutions). Solutions can be made available to instructors upon request (in Latex format, along with the questions, making it straightforward to generate assignments with and without solutions). 

Download the question library:
  * [Question Library (only questions)](https://github.com/OSTP/PhysicsArtofModelling/raw/master/QuestionLibrary_Questions.pdf)
  * [Question Library (with most answers)](https://github.com/OSTP/PhysicsArtofModelling/raw/master/QuestionLibrary_Answers.pdf)


The textbook is available in PDF, but anyone is welcome to compile their own version including or excluding chapters. This is done by modifying the file /tex/BuildingModelsToDescribeOurWorld.tex.
